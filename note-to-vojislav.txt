Hey Vojislav,

I am trying to contact you directly regarding our Mastering GitHub project.
I put my name in the list of github repos next to yours for https://github.com/lodash/lodash. At that repo, there is not much in the way of a quick 'rundown' of what lodash is or what it does, so perhaps that might be a good choice. Also, it may be practical to learn a bit about lodash since my very brief skimming of info on it suggests it's a popular JS utility library and a fork of underscore.js.

I noticed that you seem to have some PHP experience, which I do also at a very elementary level. I would also consider doing the project for https://github.com/laravel/laravel since that README.md has incomprehensible buzz words for me. I think addressing something with this repo would be more difficult than for lodash though partially because of that - I could be wrong though.

What are your thoughts?

I am on the east coast of the U.S. and so am 6 hours behind you as far as I can gather. I wanted to extend my contact information to you in case you would like to proceed to work together on this project. Please let me know at your convenience.

Regards,

Bobby Stewart
